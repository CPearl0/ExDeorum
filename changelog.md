*Ex Deorum*'s new additions are listed first, then the additions from original *Ex Nihilo*.

an alternative to mods like Twerk or Tree Growing Simulator, as a Wooden Watering Can is given to the player at the start (configurable).
The list of blocks that Watering Cans can be used on is defined by the tag `exdeorum:watering_can_blocks`.
- Added the Sculk Core, which can be used to enable player-placed Sculk Shriekers to spawn Wardens.
- Added Witch Water, which can be used to create a variety of blocks with the barrel AND it can be used to create a Netherrack generator,
replacing where regular Water would be used. (configurable)
- Added the Sieve, which uses sieve meshes to filter items. (drops are configurable through data pack)
- Added the Porcelain, Crimson, and Warped Crucibles which melt cobblestone into lava when placed above a heat source. (configurable through data pack, supports modded fluids)

- Added the Barrel, which has all of its functionality from Ex Nihilo. (Composting and Mixing recipes are configurable through data pack)
- Added the Silk Worm, which can infest a tree so that can be harvested for string. It can also be cooked and eaten... if you're desperate.
- Added the Crook, which can be used to break leaves and infested leaves for increased drop rates.
- Added the Hammer, which can be used to crush and smash blocks. (recipes are configurable through data pack)
- Added the porcelain bucket, a cheap alternative to a regular bucket in the early game with the catch that it breaks after pouring out lava.
