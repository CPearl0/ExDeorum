## Ex Deorum 1.4
- Red Sand is now obtainable by hammering crushed netherrack.
- Sieves can no longer be automated by machines (can be re-enabled in the server config.)
- Fixed desync bug when a machine like Create's Deployer interacts with the Sieve
- Fixed an edge case where a modded ore wouldn't appear if the item form wasn't in the ore's tag.
- Fixed #5, which prevented automating the Crucible

## Ex Deorum 1.3
- Allow modded ores to drop from sieving Gravel and Crushed Deepslate if a mod with that ore is installed. Supported ores are Aluminum, Cobalt, Silver, Lead, Platinum, Nickel, Uranium, Osmium, Tin, Zinc, and Iridium.
- Allow some modded drops from sieving if a mod with those resources is installed. Currently, only Grains of Infinity from Ender IO is supported.
- If you would like to see some more mod compatibility related additions to Ex Deorum, open an issue on GitHub or let me know on Discord.

## Ex Deorum 1.2
- Fixed the missing recipes for Deepslate pebbles

## Ex Deorum 1.1
- Fixed the missing barrel mixing recipe for Clay Block

## Ex Deorum 1.0  
*Ex Deorum*'s new additions are listed first, then the additions from original *Ex Nihilo*.
- Added the Watering Can, which can be used to hydrate farmland and speed up plant and tree growth. It is intended to be
an alternative to mods like Twerk or Tree Growing Simulator, as a Wooden Watering Can is given to the player at the start (configurable).
The list of blocks that Watering Cans can be used on is defined by the tag `exdeorum:watering_can_blocks`.
- Added the Sculk Core, which can be used to enable player-placed Sculk Shriekers to spawn Wardens.
- Added Witch Water, which can be used to create a variety of blocks with the barrel AND it can be used to create a Netherrack generator,
replacing where regular Water would be used. (configurable)
- Added the Sieve, which uses sieve meshes to filter items. (drops are configurable through data pack)
- Added the Porcelain, Crimson, and Warped Crucibles which melt cobblestone into lava when placed above a heat source. (configurable through data pack, supports modded fluids)
- Added Wooden Crucibles which melt plant material into water. (configurable through data pack, supports modded fluids)
- Added the Barrel, which has all of its functionality from Ex Nihilo. (Composting and Mixing recipes are configurable through data pack)
- Added the Silk Worm, which can infest a tree so that can be harvested for string. It can also be cooked and eaten... if you're desperate.
- Added the Crook, which can be used to break leaves and infested leaves for increased drop rates.
- Added the Hammer, which can be used to crush and smash blocks. (recipes are configurable through data pack)
- Added the porcelain bucket, a cheap alternative to a regular bucket in the early game with the catch that it breaks after pouring out lava.
